description: Close a verified milestone by preparing release evidence, changelog and quality updates, deployment checks, and lifecycle state for the next milestone. Use only when every feature in the milestone is passing and the project is ready to ship or transition phases.

# milestone-closer

## Gap it fills

When all features in a batch reach `passing`, there is no structured path from
"done" to "shipped." Agents either stop with no output or dive into unplanned
refactoring. A milestone closer prevents both.

## What it produces

- A `CHANGELOG.md` entry for this milestone
- Updated `quality-document.md` grades for each domain touched
- A completed deployment checklist
- An archived session log in `progress.md`
- A clean `feature_list.json` ready for the next milestone

## When to use

When a defined set of features all reach `passing` and the project is ready to
ship or move to the next phase.

## Core workflow

```
1. Confirm all milestone features are at status: passing
   - Any feature still in_progress or blocked stops this process

2. Run full verification one final time
   - ./init.sh must pass cleanly before proceeding

3. Write the CHANGELOG entry:
   - What features shipped? (list by name, not id)
   - What user-visible behavior changed?
   - What known limitations remain?

4. Update quality-document.md:
   - Grade each product domain touched this milestone (A / B / C / D)
   - Record what improved
   - Record any new gaps introduced

5. Run deployment steps (project-specific — define these in init.sh or a deploy script)

6. Archive this milestone in progress.md:
   - Mark the milestone as closed with a date
   - Record the final verification result

7. Reset feature_list.json for the next milestone:
   - Move completed features into an "archived" array at the bottom
   - Set last_updated to today
   - Add placeholder features for the next phase

8. Commit with a version tag:
   git tag v<milestone> -m "<milestone name>"
   git commit -m "Close milestone: <name>"
```

## Checklist before closing

- [ ] All milestone features at `passing`
- [ ] `./init.sh` passes
- [ ] CHANGELOG entry written
- [ ] `quality-document.md` updated
- [ ] Deployment completed (or explicitly deferred with a note)
- [ ] `progress.md` milestone entry archived
- [ ] `feature_list.json` reset for next milestone
- [ ] Commit and tag created

## Templates needed

- `changelog-entry.md` — format for one CHANGELOG milestone entry
- `deployment-checklist.md` — steps between "all passing" and "live"
- `milestone-archive.md` — format for archiving a milestone in `progress.md`
